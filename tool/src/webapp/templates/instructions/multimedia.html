<h2> ADDING MULTIMEDIA CONTENT</h2>

<p>Sample of the dialog when you click on the <b>Edit</b> button.
</div>
<div style="valign:top">
<div class="textblock">
<p> You can add movies, Flash presentations, Youtube videos, other web sites, etc., to your page.
<p> If you use <b>Add Resource</b> they will appear as a link which your readers can click.
<p> If you use <b>Add Multimedia</b> they will appear in a box within your page. An example
is shown at the right.
<p> Lesson Builder will recognize the type of file you are using and put an 
appropriate player into the page.
<p> Once you have added an item, you will probably want to use the <b> Edit </b> button
to adjust the size of the box. Unfortunately Lesson Builder is unable to determine the
size of the movie or other content automatically, so it uses a "safe" default size.
Lesson Builder will show a black box around the item, so you can see whether the item
fills the box you have specified. Students will not see the black box.
<p> For Youtube videos, you should go to a page showing the specific video
you want, and use either "Copy video URL" or simply copy the URL from the
address bar at the top of the browser. Do not use "Copy embed html".
</div>
<h2> Accessibility </h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p>If you are concerned about <b>accessibility</b> for handicapped
users, please make sure you use the <b>Edit</b> button and insert textual
descriptions for images and multimedia objects. You may want to
consider creating a separate page that presents the content in a more
accessible form and providing a link to it. One way to do this would
be using <b>Add Subpage</b>.
</div>

<h2> MULTIMEDIA FAQ </h2>

<h2> Caution about Internet Explorer </h2>

<div class="textblock">
<p> NOTE: While Lesson Builder is compatible with Internet Explorer,
we still recommend using something else (e.g. Firefox) when preparing
a page with "Add Multimedia."
Because of the way Internet Explorer implements security,
it is possible to get a page into a situation where IE won't let you edit
it.

<p> (The problem is that if it has a problem on the page, it sometimes
doesn't finish loading the page, and thus the dialogs that would let
you make changes aren't there.)

<p> Also, when working with IE, you will want to make sure that every
URL you use on the page starts with "https:". Otherwise, your users will
get warning messages, and some multimedia content will break.
</div>

<h2> Recommended Formats </h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p> For the moment, we recommend FLV video, if you don't need to use
Apple portable devices such as iPad. Lesson Builder uses a Flash player,
which does a pretty good job.
<p> If you need to work with Apple devices, your best bet is probably
MP4. However the MP4 files will need to be prepared specially. MP4 has
many options, not all of which work with iPads and iPhones. Also, not
all converters produce files that will start playing immediately, 
rather than waiting for the whole file to download. For testing
I used Quicktime Pro, and did export using the profile "Movie to iPhone."
Then rename the file from .m4v to .mp4.
<p> Unfortunately experiments with MP4 on Windows produced mixed results
when using Windows' builtin players.
For that reason Lesson Builder has been set to play MP4s using
Flash if it is available. I strongly recommend
telling your users to install Flash. Quicktime and Windows Media can
sometimes play MP4 files, but results were mixed on Windows. There
were particular problems getting the files to start playing immediately
when Flash wasn't available.

</div>
<h2> Problems with Image Size </h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p> After doing <b>Add multimedia</b>, you will probably need to use
the <b>Edit</b> button to adjust the size. The size starts out
300 pixels high and the full width of the window. This size should
let you see the content, but you may need to adjust it to match the
size of your movie or Flash program.

<p>Some players will stretch or cut cut off the image if you don't set
the right size. Older copies of Windows Media Player (e.g. on Windows
XP) seem particularly prone to this. So for movies, it is safest to
adjust the size to match the actual size and shape of the movie.
</div>
<h2> Where File Uploads Go </h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p>The "Upload file" feature will normally put files in a separate
folder for each instance of the tool (i.e. each button in the left
bar). If you prefer to organize the files yourself, you might prefer
to upload your file using the Resource tool and get them organized.
Then you can use "Choose Existing File" to put the file on a page.

<p> URLs are actually stored as files. URL's are stored in a subfolder
called <b> urls </b> of the unit's folder.
</div>

<h2> Helping your Users </h2>

<div class="textblock">
<p> Unfortunately the ability to play movies, Flash, etc, tends to
vary from browser to browser. You may want to create a unit that
has one of each type of file you're going to use. That way students
can make sure that they have the right plugins installed at the
beginning of the course.
</div>
<h2> Problems we've seen </h2>
<div class="textblock">
<ul>
<li> The Macintosh Windows Media player will sometimes give you a blank
image unless the file is public. You can set files public in the
<b>Resources</b> tool using <b>Edit Details</b>. If you have a number of files that
need to be public, you can set an entire folder public.
<p>
<li> Some players will not play content if you are using an https: URL
and the site you're pointing to does not have a proper certificate
installed.
<p>
<li> Internet Explorer will give warning messages unless all content
on the page uses https: URLs. Files that are stored on Sakai will
automatically be served with an appropriate URL, but if you define
any URLs for yourself, you shold be careful about this.
<p>
<li> With Safari on the Macintosh, if you edit a Youtube video, and
change the URL, when the page updates the player isn't there. If you
refresh the page it works fine. Everything works fine for normal
users.
<p>
<li> On Windows, users may need to adjust the secuity settings in
Internet Explorer. For some player types, Active X needs to be
enabled. You may not get any sign that this is the problem with IE,
just an empty box where your content should be.
<p>
<li> If a plugin needs to talk to the user, it may fail. E.g. after
installing Acrobat, the first time you run Acrobat, you need to accept
the license. With Firefox you are prompted to do this. With Internet
Explorer, it simply gives you an empty box where your content should
be.
