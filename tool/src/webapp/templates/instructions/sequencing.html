<h2> SEQUENCING IN LESSON BUILDER</h2>

<table>

<div class="textblock">
<p> Some of our users need to be able to control the order in which 
students can do items. In some cases these requirements are mandated
by external groups, particularly for material used in certification.

<p> Lesson Builder has facilities to do this. However the approach
is different than in some systems. Lesson Builder tries to avoid
forcing students to take
a specific path through the material. Rather, it allows you
to declare specific requirements, but it allows students the
freedom to look ahead and review when doing so would not
violate your requirements.

<p> This is done by specifying that some items are required. If
necessary you may also declare that some items can't be done until all
required items before it are finished. [We are planning to implement
alternatives, so that you can specify that either of two or more
alternatives will satisfy the requirement.]

<p> For an example, see the screen shot in the right margin.

<p>Example 1. Sample of a page with two required items. One has been done and one has not. The following
test is grayed out until both required items are done.

<h2> An Example </h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p> A typical scenario would be:
<ul>
<li> Each unit has some reading material and a quiz.
An agency requires that students can't get credit unless
they have read some of the material.
<li> Once students have completed all units, they take
a final certification test.
</ul>

<p> To do this, you would organize the material into
units, with a quiz as the last item in each.
You would use the <b>Edit</b> button to set some
fo the readings as "Required." For the unit quiz,
you would check "Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed".
When "Don't Release.." is checked, the item will be grayed out until all items
above it that are marked "Required" have been finished.

<p> You can also declare a whole unit
units as "Required", using the <b> Settings </b>
button next to the unit Title. <p> In our example,
all units would be set to "Requited."
There would be a
final unit that contains only the final certification
test. It would be set "Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed".
</div>
<h2> Forcing a specific order </h2>

<div class="textblock">
<p> We recommend not specifying more requirements than
are needed. By making all items required and restricting
access to them, it would be possible to force students
to do items in a fixed order. But normally there's no need
to do this.

<p> To require items to be done in
order, you would set them all as required, 
and then set every one except the first as
"Don't Release Item Until All Prerequisites are Completed".
Because "don't release" releases an item when all
items above it have been finished, this would 
force them to be done in sequence.
</div>

<h2> Details </h2>
<div class="textblock">
<p> Required tests and assignments are a bit
more complex than readings. You can simply
require that the student do them. But you
can also require a minimum score.

<p> If you set a minimum score, think about
what to do if the student doesn't make it.
You may want to allow the assignment or test
to be resubmitted. That is controlled
in the Assignment or Tests and Quizes tool.

<p> Note that it is possible to have more than
one item declared "Don't Release ..." within
a unit. Thus it
would be possible to have several required
readings, an assignment that isn't available
until they are done, some more readings, and
then a final quiz or assignment. An item
marked "Don't release" is available when all
of the required items <b> above it</b> have 
been done.

<p> That means that you can force students to do the items in a unit
in order by making them all required, and setting all but the first as
"Don't Release ...". However Lesson Builder was not designed with this
approach in mind, and may not be the best tool for a strict linear
sequence.
