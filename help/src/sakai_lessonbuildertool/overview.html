<h2>LessonBuilder: Overview</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Lesson Builder is a way to structure content. Use cases include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Online courses, which often want to structure material by unit or week. It must be easy to link to quizzes and assignments, and to handle common types of content.</li>
    <li>Online training, which needs to define sequences of material.</li>
    <li>Online certification, which needs to require certain items to be done, and sometimes to limit access until prerequisites are met.</li>
    <li>Import of publisher content or content from other systems that support Common Cartridge (import only at the moment).</li>
</ul>
